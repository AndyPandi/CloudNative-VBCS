# Part 2: User Interface

## Introduction
In this part of the lab you will be creating a UI front end and bind the data from the BO's to the UI Components. You also build, a Create, an Edit screens and a Delete function.

### Steps
----
#### 1. Adding Header
> The next two steps is to get you to the main page of your application

![alt text](../resources/images/ui/31-new.png)

> Now select and drag and drop the header component from the component palette to your application build screen

#### 2. Adding seperator line
> What we will start with is to place a header and a seperator line onto the main application page.

#### 3. Adding Table
> Next is to add a Table Component in which we will expose the Employee data in to your main application page. You will be guided on retrieving data from the Employee Business Object and binding it to the UI Component.

#### 4. Adjust view
> Now the Employee Data is presented in a table component, you might want to view the full page view. Instead of zoom in and zoom out each time, we can set the page to `Fit`. The following steps will illustrate that.

![alt text](../resources/images/ui/47.png "Logo Title Text 1")

![alt text](../resources/images/ui/48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

<!--
#### 5. Adjust Table
Now we have a full view of the table, we most probably want to change the name or the sequence of the table columns. The following steps will guide you how this can be done.

![alt text](../resources/images/ui/49.png "Logo Title Text 1")

![alt text](../resources/images/ui/50.png "Logo Title Text 1")

![alt text](../resources/images/ui/51.png "Logo Title Text 1")

![alt text](../resources/images/ui/52.png "Logo Title Text 1")

![alt text](../resources/images/ui/53.png "Logo Title Text 1")

![alt text](../resources/images/ui/54.png "Logo Title Text 1")

-->

#### 5. Change Picture component in Table
> Now we have a full view of the table, we most probably want to change the way we present the picture. The following steps will guide you how this can be done.

#### 6. Adding actions
> Now you're done with your table, next is adding some actions to the data. The next few steps will guide you on adding a Create Employee function and Edit Employee function. You will notice that VBCS has some nice pre-built quickstarts to help you generating the various pages and linking the navigation.

#### 8. Adding Edit page
> Next section of this lab, we will guide you on how to add a `Edit Employee` function. Before that we need to make sure we are back to out application `main-start` page.

#### 9. Adding Delete
